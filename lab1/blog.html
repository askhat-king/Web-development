        <p class="viet">In April 2019, I got to make my way over a new country-Vietnam.<br>
        Vietnam is truly a country with so much to offer and is full of surprises. It absolutely blew me away, as I didn’t have any expectations and hadn’t done a lot of research beforehand about it. We travelled from Ho Chi Minh (also known as Saigon), to the Mekong Delta, flew up to the beachside city of Nha Trang, then the ancient town of Hoi An, drove up to the old city of Hue, experienced a night on a junk boat in Halong Bay, and ended the tour in the capital, Hanoi. There were so many incredibly beautiful places that took my breath away, and remain ingrained in my heart forever. The most memorable place had to be Hoi An, the ancient town I fell in love with. Saigon was quite memorable too, as never in my life had I seen so many scooters in one city before…it was pure chaos, but so interesting to witness and see how the locals get by. My favourite part about Vietnam would definitely have to be the nature; the mountains, rice paddies, lakes, beaches and islands. It was so picturesque, and I think quite underrated as I hadn’t heard much about it prior to visiting.</p>

        <p class="viet">Football World Cup-2018 was hosted in Russia, so i planned to travel Russia and watch the final match of WC. I came to Russia on 10th august and had 3 days of walking through Moscow watching sightseeings. I was surprised by the city and the people. I had a lot of conversation on a Red Square, people were polite and kind, answering to all my questions. I learned a lot about their culture and history. I was quite shocked after seeing a lot of beautiful scyscrapers and got a lot inspiration. On 14th of august, i watched the final match and then went home.</p>
